        <h2>Total Species Photographed So Far: 124</h2>

        <p id="about">My interest in birds only truly started in 2020 but once it started, it took off. I 
            decided to express my love of birds in the form of photography. I've been photographing birds
            for a little under a year, and it's allowed me to see many different behaviors that I never would
            have noticed before. My favorite birds (at the moment) are Harris's Hawks and Vermillion
            Flycatchers.
